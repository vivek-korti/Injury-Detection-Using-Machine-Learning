# Injury-Detection-Using-Machine-Learning
This project leverages machine learning algorithms to predict and detect potential injuries in athletes or workers based on biometric, environmental, or activity data. By analyzing historical patterns and real-time inputs, the model aims to provide early warnings to reduce the risk of injuries and support preventive healthcare strategies. Techniques include supervised learning for classification, time-series analysis for real-time monitoring, and model interpretability for actionable insights.
